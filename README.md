## Recommendation


Leverage Annual Growth 
With a significant 37% growth from 2016 to 2017, continue to invest in marketing and customer acquisition strategies that are proving effective. Analyze what contributed to this growth and amplify those efforts.

 Maximize Monthly Peaks   March Promotions
 Since March was the peak month in 2017, consider running special promotions or events in March to drive even more orders. This could include limited-time offers or seasonal products. Holiday Season Preparation Prepare for another potential peak in November, as seen in 2016. Stock up on popular items and consider special holiday-themed products or gift packages to attract customers.


Increase Efficiency and Staff on Busy Days: Saturdays and Fridays Given that these are the busiest days, ensure you have enough staff to handle the higher volume of orders. Consider extending operating hours or offering special deals to attract even more customers .Wednesdays and Thursdays: Evaluate the decision to close on these days. If opening is not feasible, perhaps offer online ordering or delivery to maintain some level of business activity.
